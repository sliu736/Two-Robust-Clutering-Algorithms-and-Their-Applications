# Introduction
BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies) and ROCK (RObust Clustering using linKs) are two kinds of common large sample robust clustering algorithms. In this paper, R language is used to realize the above two kinds of algorithms, where simulation and real data sets are analyzed and compared.
